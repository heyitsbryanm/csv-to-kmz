It is in the Banglamphu area of about 1 kilometre north of the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew. Also known as the backpacker's party road."
Rajadamnern Boxing Stadium,partying,http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l_hOW-dxlQs/VF3G4A5QaoI/AAAAAAAAo_k/bFFsCkjU2x4/s1600/Rajadamnern-Stadium.jpg,"13.7611978, 100.5088608","Khao San Road’s reputation as the ultimate backpacker party hub is known across Southeast Asia. Budget guesthouses, internet cafes, bars, restaurants, massage parlors, travel agents, bookshops, market stalls, tattoo shops and hawkers line the 1-km stretch of mayhem while eating, drinking and dancing in the street is encouraged.

Though not much has changed here in years, the iconic road is slowly starting to draw in more of a young local crowd who aren’t scared away by the sea of sweaty travelers downing buckets and screaming along to Wonderwall by Oasis. The ingeniously named The Club is the go-to spot around midnight for real dance music and there’s also the much smaller but equally fun Lava Gold up the road. Brick Bar (at Buddy Shopping Plaza, next to McDonald's) is where the locals go; the main draw here is the brilliant live band who play fun Thai pop, ska, reggae and western covers. There are a thousand other street-side bars to choose from, and its best to just turn up and see which one takes your pick.

The crowd: Backpackers, gap year students, a few families looking a bit bewildered, and an ever-growing number of young Thais. As for what to wear – whatever’s in your suitcase that is passable for clean.

The crowd: A good mix of expats and tourists of all ages means Soi 11 isn’t really reserved for any group in particular. Most of the bars here couldn’t care less what you’re wearing, but it’s best to play it safe and go smart casual (such as no shorts or flip-flops).

Oskar Bistro and Marshmallow Kitchen & Bar provide more of a sophisticated ambience. To get a better perspective on things, head up to the top floor of Le Fenix Hotel and lounge about on the bed-style sofas at Nest, or better yet try the gorgeous Above Eleven rooftop bar on the 38th floor of Fraser Suites. To end the night, the go-to club is Levels Club, which plays commercial dance and hip hop with free entry and drinks for ladies.

It’s easily one of the most stunning temples in Bangkok, not only because of its riverside location but also because the design is very different from the other temples you can visit in Bangkok. Wat Arun (nicknamed the Temple of the Dawn) is partly made up of colorfully decorated spires and stands majestically over the water. Beautiful sunset."

This red-light district has a more laid-back, carnival-like feel to it than Patpong or Nana Plaza. Flashing neon lights up a colorful streetscape of 20 or so go-go bars that line its sides. Don’t be shy, it’s pretty easygoing and open-minded, entry is always free, and drink’s prices are fixed. 

Soi Cowboy is just next to Terminal 21, a very popular new shopping mall, so just cross the street and see it for yourself… or use Terminal 21 as an excuse to have a quick peek. Remember, you might not see this again anywhere else in the world!"
